                The ancient name of Santorini was Strongyli due to the shape of the island. Santorini was named by the Latin Empire in the 13th century, and is a reference to Saint Irene, from the name of the old cathedral in the village of Perissa – the name Santorini is a contraction of the name Santa Irini. n alternative name for Santorini is Thira. Santorini is also a name for the family of islands surrounding Thira, once forming a single island prior to a major volcanic event known in human history in approximately 1628 BC. Santorini is one of the great natural wonders of the world, and its main attraction is the landscape and seascape of the island itself. In all, there have been at least twelve large explosive volcanic eruptions, but the configuration of the present, roughly semicircular island is the result of an enormous volcanic explosion which occurred probably around 1630 BC, literally blowing the top off the island and changing what had been a typical half-submerged mountain of an Aegean island into a flooded crescent caldera, in the middle of which a few small smoking islands still bear witness to volcanic activity. Some have speculated that this event was the inspiration for the myth of Atlantis. The towns of Fira, Ia (also known as Oia), and Thirasis cling to the steep cliffs facing into the caldera bay.
